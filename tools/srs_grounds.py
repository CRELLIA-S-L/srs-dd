"""The grounds checker: reads the register beside specs/ and reports on it.

    python3 tools/srs_grounds.py             check and rewrite 90-dashboard.md

                                             files belong to are staked on

The register's format is described in grounds/README.md — that file is the
normative one; this script only enforces it. Standard library only,
compatible with Python 3.9.

The requirement model is read by running tools/srs_view.py as a subprocess
rather than importing the checker: an optional subsystem must not die on the
mandatory one's configuration before it can say anything of its own, and a
register whose specification is broken still has plenty to report.
