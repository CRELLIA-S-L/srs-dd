"""Freeze the specification: write the baseline row.

    python3 tools/srs_baseline.py 1.2.0 --dry-run
    python3 tools/srs_baseline.py 1.2.0

It writes the row into `specs/92-baselines.md` — version, date, and what
changed since the previous baseline — and stops. Committing is yours, with
whatever git client the project uses; a `spec/vX.Y.Z` tag is a bookmark you
may add afterwards or never, because the row is what makes the baseline.

Where such a tag was made first, the row describes that revision rather than
the working tree, so writing it late costs nothing in accuracy.

A baseline is not a release. It freezes what the system must do; a release
ships what it does. Neither implies the other, and the same number in both
places means nothing.

Exit codes: 0 written · 2 refused, having changed nothing.
