# SRS-DD-VERSION — the framework release this file came from
"""Reads the physical shape of a record, and nothing about its meaning.

A record is a level-three heading carrying an identifier, a fenced
`yaml` block of flat keys, and prose until the next heading. More than
one format uses that shape on purpose, so that a reader who knows one
recognises the other without learning a second syntax (ADR-0015).

This module finds the boundaries of a record and splits every field it
carries **without knowing their names or how many there are**. It
returns the identifier as written — junk included — the title, the
fields, the body and the line. What a field means, which are required,
which are retired, and whether an identifier is well-formed belong to
whoever calls it (ADR-0019).

What an identifier *looks* like is theirs too, and arrives as the
`heading` pattern: the two formats number their entries differently,
one in three parts and one in two, and neither grammar is a property
of the shape. That pattern is meant to be a broad net — anything
ID-shaped captured, junk included, judged loudly afterwards — because
a malformed identifier must never be skipped silently.

The errors it reports are the ones no caller can recover from: a
metadata line with no colon, a duplicate key, a fence that never
closes, a record with no metadata block at all.

Standard library only, compatible with Python 3.9.
