"""Write into each requirement the date its identifier first appeared.

    python3 tools/srs_dates.py             date what is undated
    python3 tools/srs_dates.py --dry-run   say what would be written

The date git already holds, written into the block once so that every
lifecycle reading afterwards comes off the file rather than out of the log.
Requirements that already carry a `created` date are left exactly as they
are, which is what makes a second run cost nothing.

This is the one command that writes requirement blocks. It is run on
purpose, by a person, the way a baseline is frozen — never by a gate, a
hook or an installer.

Standard library only, compatible with Python 3.9.
