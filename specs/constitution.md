# Constitution

Standing engineering principles of the project. Every plan and every diff is
checked against them. Unlike requirements (what the system does) and ADRs
(single decisions with their context), articles apply to all work at all
times and change only through the amendment procedure in ART-090.

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Ratified:** 2026-08-05

Articles are numbered in steps of 10 and referenced from plans, reviews, and
ADRs the same way requirements are: “rejected per ART-040”. The set below is
a starting point — adapt the articles to your project, but keep the
amendment procedure.

## ART-010 — Hierarchy of truth

The specification stands above the code; the code stands above all other
documentation. On conflict, neither side is silently fixed: the discrepancy
is recorded in `91-open-issues.md` and the maintainer decides which side is
wrong.

## ART-020 — Requirement before code

No behavior changes without a requirement that describes the change. The
mechanics — statuses, numbering, closing the loop — live in
`specs/README.md`; this article only makes the principle non-negotiable.

## ART-030 — Boundaries of agent autonomy

Within an established requirement, an agent edits code and specification
freely. Builds, test runs, external network calls, data migrations, and
deletion of files it did not create require the user's explicit
confirmation — each time, not once per session.

## ART-040 — Simplicity

The boring solution wins by default; a clever one must earn its place in an
ADR. A new dependency requires an ADR. Project tooling stays
standard-library only. Nothing is built for a requirement that does not
exist yet.

## ART-050 — Testing discipline

A requirement with `verification: T` is flipped to `implemented` in the same
set of edits that adds its test, and the test path goes into the `tests`
field. Verification by `D`, `I`, or `A` is carried out as described in
`50-verification.md`, not by assertion.

## ART-060 — Quality gates

A change merges only when `python3 tools/srs_check.py` passes and, if the
change alters behavior, the commit or PR description names the requirement
identifiers it implements.

## ART-090 — Amendments

The constitution changes only by a dedicated commit that bumps the version:
MAJOR — an article is removed or reversed; MINOR — an article is added;
PATCH — wording changes without a change of meaning. The commit message
states the reason. The project maintainer ratifies the amendment.
